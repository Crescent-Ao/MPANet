#MPANet:Multi-Patch Attention for Infrared Target Detection
Hello,every one.This is MPAnet offical implementation.In this repo ,I will integrate nearly all
metric to this model.Because it is my first one to update a complete repo. It exists some errors in this repo.If you have
any problems, I am able to try my best to resolve your problems.
###MPANet network
A MPANet framework
based on the axial-attention encoder and the multi-scale patch
branch (MSPB) structure is proposed to highlight the small
targets and suppress background without any classification
backbones. In the designed MSPB, coarse-grained features
extracted by the large-scale branch and fine-grained features
extracted by the local branches are fused through the de-
veloped bottom-up structure. Extensive experiments on the
public SIRST dataset.
